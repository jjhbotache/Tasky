# TodoTechnicalTest

## Features

- **Basic Structure**: The application is built with React and TypeScript, providing a robust and typed foundation for development.
- **Session Storage**: Tasks are stored using the browser's Session Storage, ensuring they persist while the browser session is active.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: The application is divided into components for adding, listing, editing, and deleting tasks.
