## Features

- **Basic Structure**: The application is built with React and TypeScript, providing a robust and typed foundation for development.
- **Session Storage**: Tasks are stored using the browser's Session Storage, ensuring they persist while the browser session is active.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: The application is divided into components for adding, listing, editing, and deleting tasks.
- **Custom Hooks**: Logic for managing tasks is encapsulated in custom hooks, promoting code reuse and separation of concerns.
- **Generative AI Suggestions**: Integrated with Google Generative AI to provide task suggestions using the `useGemini` hook.
- **Image Integration**: Integrated with Pixabay to fetch relevant images for tasks using the `usePixabay` hook.
